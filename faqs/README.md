## Is there a certificate for this course?
If you are taking this course through WDSS and want to receive the certificate, you should submit all the notebooks with solutions of the homework exercises to [education@wdss.io](mailto:education@wdss.io). They will assess your progress and based on that you will be issued the certificate. Only the general homework exercises are taken into consideration. It is therefore important to **save all your homework notebooks** as evidence of completing the course. **Note**: the solutions to the homework exercises are also available on the course website but you are encouraged not to look into those and tackle the questions by yourself. For the course run in Term 2 2021 the deadline for submitting your work is the **first day of Term 3 - Monday 26 April 2021**

If you are taking this course independently but still wish to receive the certificate, reach out to [Dominika Dara≈º(https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominika-dara%C5%BC-b13335162/) (course coordinator)

## When and how should I submit the homework?
The homework notebooks should be submitted directly to your mentor. You can submit all your notebooks in one batch at the end of the course or send them to your mentor regularly as the course progresses. What matters is that your mentor receives your work before the deadline. The way of how you can send the notebooks should be agreed on between you end your mentor (for example through email or Teams).


## I take the course through WDSS. Do I need to attend the live teaching events?
Live teaching events are not compulsory. If you are not able or opt not to attend our live teaching events, then you may follow the course content at your own pace - all of the recordings and materials are available through the website. However, we strongly recommend that you attend the live events as it gives you the chance to clarify any doubts as soon as they arise and they keep you engaged with the course.
