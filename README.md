### Issue Reporting

The WDSS team have put their heart and soul (and some hundreds of hours) into producing the material in this course. After devoting that much energy, we want the resources to be as perfect as possible. For that reason, if you come across any issue (spelling/grammar mistake, incorrect code, confusing points), no matter how small, please report it [here](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety/sql-for-scientists/issues). It only takes a few moments and we'll massively appreciate it!
