## Getting Started

### About the Course
The WDSS Deep-Dive Into SQL course is designed for anyone wanting to gain or improve their SQL skills. As such it is suitable for complete beginners, but dives deep enough to interest more experienced SQLers. This course covers querying a database, from very simple to more advanced queries. This is a fast-paced course designed to make you into a competent user of SQL in just two weeks. Our session recordings will be uploaded to Youtube and all of our resources are free to be used by anyone, so if you miss out you can still complete this course on a self-paced manner, although we do recommend attending the live sessions to enhance your learning.

### Setup Guide
#### Using Beekeeper Studio (recommended)
In order to engage both with the course content and homeworks you will require access to our hosted databases via a MySQL-supported client. Whilst there are many options for this, we recommend using Beekeeper studio as it is free, open-source, and extremely easy to download and use. [Follow this link to download Beekeeper.](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) 

#### Connecting to the course database
Once you have an SQL client set up, you're gonna want to connect to the WDSS-hosted databases for this course. To do this using Beekeper, select a `MySQL` connection and input the login details below:
- Host: `sql.wdss.io`
- Port: `33061`
- Username: `guest`
- Password: `relational`


### Issue Reporting

The WDSS team have put their heart and soul (and some hundreds of hours) into producing the material in this course. After devoting that much energy, we want the resources to be as perfect as possible. For that reason, if you come across any issue (spelling/grammar mistake, incorrect code, confusing points), no matter how small, please report it [here](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety/sql-for-scientists/issues). It only takes a few moments and we'll massively appreciate it!

## Accessing Resources

### Resource List

This course is jam-packed with content, which may make it seem a little daunting at first but don't worry. The teaching is designed in such a way that you can pick the content that is most relevant to you to tailor your learning experience. Here are the different types of resources available and why you may or may not want to use them.

#### Session files
After each session a `.sql` file containing all of the queries exemplified during the session will be added. You may want to use these to review the material, help you with homework, or simply recreate the results observed.


#### Homework exercises
For each session there will be a corresponding file with homework exercises for you to review the content taught, and these will generally be uploaded one or two days after the corresponding session. You should attempt these as it will aid in solidifying your understanding, and you will be required to submit all completed homework sheets (more info below) in order to recieve a digital Course Completion Certificate. If you're struggling with any of the excercises or have completed them and wish to have a look at the solutions, reach out to any of the [contact points](#contact) for help.
